C profiler:
 How it works?
 	1) instrumentation: inserting some peice of code before and after calling functions: deterministic profilers: comes at a cost of measuring time additionally: but very accurate
 	tradeoff accuracy and high cost:
 	2) sampling: assuming 80% of work will be done in 20% of the code: just look once in a while. Eg: gprof
 	update a table looking at interrupts of certain frequencies(mostly at some system clock frequency)
 	based on PC value at that time of interrupt and using offsets, it estimates the time spent in that function 

On Stack: return addresses etc are PC values at some time and are virtual addresses
