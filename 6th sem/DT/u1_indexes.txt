Gate Smashers - TYPES OF INDICES: Primary, Clustered, Secondary Indices

			Key	Non-key
			
Ordered data   ->    Primary	Cluster  	=> CLUSTERED(Sparse(preferred)/dense)
Unordered data ->   Secondary	Secondary       => NON CLUSTERED (Always dense)
						 (can make sparse for non-key
						 by using indirection and buckets) 

Multilevel index
First level - dense/sparse
Next levels - always sparse!
